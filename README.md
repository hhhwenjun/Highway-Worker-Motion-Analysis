# Motion Analysis Project

### Project Introduction:

The project collected motion data from heavy duty worker thourgh IMU sensors located on their back and right upper arm. The aims of the project is to identify the worker motion/activity through the machine learning models. Location data of the workers is collected as well for trajectory visualization.

### Data Description: 

The data inlcudes two sections: 1) location data with timestamp and 2) motion data from IMU sensors. The motion data includes orientation of pitch, yaw and roll; normalized accelerometer data in X, Y, Z direction; and normalized gyroscope data in X, Y, Z direction.

### Data Analytics
